# CLI Trance

**CLITrance** is a lightweight command-line OSINT tool designed to help you trace usernames, emails, and domains across public data sources.

The goal is to provide focused, modular recon capabilities — without bloated dependencies — to assist ethical hackers, students, and researchers.

More modules and intelligence scoring coming soon.
